The basic concept here is to subsample reads for a species with high quality, high depth data, and to determine if we can obtain similar results using angsd. 

All pipeline implementation and development will be done in snakemake, and I will probably use perl scripts to compare the results among alterantive high depth/low depth pipelines.
